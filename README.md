# CS 683 Course Project

## Repository structure

In the top level directory, we have the ChampSim trace-based simulator as a Git submodule, and a `papers` directory which stores the reference papers (Hawkeye (ISCA 2016) and Mockingjay (ISCA 2022)) that we used, along with the paper we actually implemented, called `paper.pdf`.
